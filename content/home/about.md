subtitle: I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the Massachusetts Institute
  of Technology (MIT), concentrating in security studies and comparative politics.
  My research interests include political violence, security bureaucracies, and 
  varieties of repression, with a focus on Latin America.
  Prior to starting at MIT, I was a Junior Fellow in the South Asia Program at The Stimson Center. 
  I graduated with a B.A. in Political Science and an M.A. in International Relations 
  from the University of Chicago in 2020. I have native fluency in Spanish, 
  advanced proficiency in French, and reading proficiency in Portuguese and Italian.
